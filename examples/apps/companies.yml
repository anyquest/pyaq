        Here is JSON list with objects representing companies. 
        Each company has two properties: 'Company' and 'Location'.
        
        Your task is to enrich this data with additional information about the companies.
        
        In particular, you need to add two new properties, 'Sector' and 'Industry', and 
        populate them with the information about the sector and industry of the company 
        using the GICS taxonomy.

        Also, you need to add a 'Website' property with the URL of the company website, 
        and a 'Description' property with a short description of the company. 

        Finally, add the 'Size' property with the values of 'Small', 'Medium', or 'Large'
        depending on the estimated number of employees of the company.
        
        Use the web search tool to find the information. If you cannot find the exact 
        match, make your best guess based on the information you can find. 
        
        Leave the properties blank for companies where you cannot make a guess. 
        
        Use this JSON format for your output:
