        Here is a list of pages visited by a prospect on our website:
        {{read_request.pages}}
        Visit each link and create a brief summary of the prospect's interests in
        our company, products, and services. In particular, I am interested
        in the business problem that the prospect is trying to solve.

        Someone from {{identify_prospect.company.name}} visited our website. 
        If a shorter version of this company name is used colloquially, use that shorter version.
        
        Here is some information about {{identify_prospect.company.name}}: 
        {{identify_prospect}}
        
        Here is a summary of their interests based on browsing history: 
        {{summarize_interests}} 
        
        Use this information to draft an effective prospecting email that an account executive can 
        send to his or her contacts at the company to set up a sales discovery meeting.
        
        Remember, the key is to keep it professional, concise, focused, and personalized. 
        Avoid generic sales pitches and aim to establish a connection based on their needs and interests.
